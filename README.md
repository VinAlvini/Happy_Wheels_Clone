#Notes:
<p>
I usually start my Unity projects using other people art (code) in order to better understand what involved <br>
This was a great example, but it had flaws I wanted to correct.
  
  1. I re-aranged the car parts to give better dynamics
  2. I added game objects to re-start the game if the driver dies (falls on head)
  3. I added colliders and hindges to the drivers head in order to get the "bobble head effect" and reset game when upside down 
  4. Added colliders /bumpers with physics materials so the car would not get stuck in strange positions
